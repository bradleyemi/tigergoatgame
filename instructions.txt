#  BAGH-CHAL is a Nepalese board game #
#  for two players. One player        #
#  controls the four tigers, and the  #
#  other player controls the twenty   #
#  goats. The goal of the game for    #
#  the tigers is to eat all the goats #
#  by jumping over them, and the goal #
#  of the goats is to surround the    #
#  tigers so they cannot move.        #
#                                     #
#  The players move in succession.    #
#  The tigers start at the corners.   #
#  Until all goats are placed, the    #
#  goat player must use their turn    #
#  to place goats one at a time on    #
#  vacant tiles. On all other turns,  #
#  both players can move their pieces #
#  to adjacent tiles only along the   #
#  lines of the board. The only       #
#  exception is that a tiger can      #
#  jump over a goat to eat it.        #
#                                     #
#  The game ends when there are no    #
#  more goats or when the tigers can  #
#  no longer move (or when one player #
#  forfeits).                         #
#                                     #
